Project Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early diagnosis is crucial for treatment and prevention. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical data.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Feature selection to identify the most relevant clinical features
Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms:
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression
Model evaluation and comparison based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which contains several attributes related to heart health, such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and more.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/Elfin-Sniper/Heart-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning.git
cd Heart-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Install dependencies: This project uses Python 3.x. Install the required packages by running:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the main script: Execute the main script to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate results.

bash

python main.py
Adjust Parameters: You can adjust model parameters within the main.py file or any relevant configuration files.

Model Training and Evaluation
Each model is trained using a portion of the dataset and evaluated based on several metrics. The following steps are included in the training pipeline:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
Feature scaling and normalization
Model training with cross-validation
Model evaluation and comparison
Results
The results of each algorithm are compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Random Forest model is particularly effective for heart disease prediction due to its robustness against overfitting and high interpretability.
